- 👋 Hi, I’m @ricamarizsoriano! You may call me Rica. 
- 👀 I’m interested in ...erpnext.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...everything related with erpnext.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... erpnext, to anyone willing to teach me. I'm basically starting from scratch. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... here for now, please. When you're interested to help me or train me, please do respond here. I'm from the Philippines! :)
      I hope to reach out ERPNext experts from around the world. An hour of your time to teach me and give me assignments would be a big help.
      Thanks a lot!
